# project-2

The purpose of this project is to create a web app, using different CRUD method.

This web app is known as BookExchange, where it aims to cultivate the idea of book exchange or book sharing. There were many campaigns on book sharing all over the world. The practice of leaving a book in a public place to be picked up and read by others, who then do likewise (also known as book-crossing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BookCrossing ) were also significant in many countries. 

Book sharing encourages more people to pick up reading as a hobby and subsequently (doing likewise), encourage those around them to pick up reading. It comes with a benefit of the varieties of books you can read without even purchasing them.
